# **REQUIREMENTS**

## **Introduction**
The objective of the project is to design and implement an ultrasonic distance meter. The device described can detect the target and calculate the distance of the target. The ultrasonic distance meter is a low cost, and simple device for distance measurement. The device calculates the distance with suitable accuracy and resolution.

## Future Scope
  #####  Can provide voice feedback system.

## Features and Timeline
##### - Ease of use.
##### - Cost effective.
##### - Measures accurate distance.
##### -  Measures objects regardless of shape, color or surface texture.

## Defining our System
This system is used to monitor the distance between ultrasonic sensor and object. Microcontroller ATmega328 is used to control the whole process. Ultrasonic sensor will be having transmitter and receiver in it. Transmitter continuously transmits the signal and whenever obstacle approaches the  sensor then that transmitted signal hits the object, bounce back and is received by ultrasonic receiver. That sensor sensed signal with respect to distance is then send to microcontroller, microcontroller in turn displays the measured distance value on LCD.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
### Strengths
##### -Simple device for distance measuremen.
##### -Cost effective.
##### -Maintenance is easy.
   
### Weakness
##### -Limited range.
   
### Opportunities
##### -Implement can be possible by adding camera for extra accuracy.
   
### Threats
##### -Incase high voltage occurs device may get damge

## 4W's and 1H
#### Who
Visual impaired person can use it for obstacle detection for assisantance example by implementing this system on white cane etc.
#### What
This system is used for measuring the distance between the object or obstacle as it provides accurate distance.
#### When
This system isn used when we want to calculate the approxomate distance from a particular object inorder to avoid the obstacle.
#### Where
 It is used in several applications, like in measuring liquid level, checking proximity and even more popularly in automobiles to assist in self-parking or anti-collision systems.
 
 System designed can be implemented in several applications, like obstacle detection, in industries, companies also has applications in robotics.
#### How
 As the ultrasonic sensor uses transmitter to transmit sound waves and oncethe transmitted wave  bounce back and is received by ultrasonic receiver. By using the reciver timing distance is calculated.
